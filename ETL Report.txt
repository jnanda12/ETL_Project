FIFA World Cup 2014 ETL Report

For our ETL project, we decided to focus our efforts on data concerning the 2014 FIFA World Cup. 
Our data sources were two CSV files from a website called 'FootyStats.org'. The first contained statistics on the teams that 
played in the tournament and the second contained individual player statistics. 

We extracted our world cup data by loading the two CSV files into a Jupyter notebook and using Pandas read and store them into 
separate data frames. 

Our transformation process consisted of deleting unnecessary columns from both data frames, as many of the column headers 
(particularly those in the team data) contained statistics that were fringe and unimportant for our purposes. We also renamed several 
of the column names in the player data frame to increase uniformity in naming convention between the two tables. Last, we encountered 
a problem in which "Ivory Coast" in the team data frame was listed as "Côte d'Ivoire" in the player data. To enable ourselves to use 
join the two tables using "Country" as the team data's primary key and "Nationality" as the player data's foreign key, we renamed 
the country "Côte d'Ivoire".

To load the data, we first created a database and two tables in MySQL workbench designed to fit the parameters of our data. 
We then connected our engine within our Jupyter notebook and converted both dataframes into SQL tables. Finally, we used Pandas to 
read an SQL query to join our tables on "team country = player nationality". This represented a one to many relationship 
(illustrated in the attached diagram) of many players to one national team. As our database currently stands, we have a list of 
all players in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, aggregated by country and joined with team stats, ready for further analysis.
